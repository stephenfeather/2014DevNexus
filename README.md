## Cross platform Native Development with Titanium

The repo is split into 3 different parts, with each part being a branch. Tables were used instead of ListViews so that it would build on Mobile web, iOS and Android.

#### Part 1: Hello World

This is a very basic Alloy application. Custom splash screens and icons have been added.

#### Part 2: Hello Devnexus

We begin by showing how easy it is to remove the label from the default project and add in a logo of our own.

#### Part 3: Hello Devnexus Presenters

We add a tableview which is populated from an array of speakers from the 2014 Devnexus event.  Add functionality of a detail screen.
